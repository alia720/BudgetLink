## The Problem I'm Solving

Building budgets with friends, family, or roommates shouldn't require everyone to sign up for Yet Another Appâ„¢. BudgetLink works like PCPartPicker but for money - create a budget, get a memorable link like `budgetlink.com/sunny-red-panda`, and share it with anyone.

**No accounts. No friction. Just budgets that work.**

## What Makes This Different

**Shareable by Design**  
Every budget gets a human-readable URL. Share it in Slack, text it to your roommate, or bookmark it for later.

**Privacy When You Need It**  
Add password protection for sensitive budgets, or create view-only tokens for stakeholders who need to see but not edit.

**Built for Speed**  
Serverless architecture means your budgets load instantly and scale automatically. No more waiting for "the app to catch up."

**Zero Barrier to Entry**  
No email verification, no password requirements, no premium tiers. Just open the site and start budgeting.

## Tech framework

I built BudgetLink on AWS serverless because your budget shouldn't go down when you need it most. Here's what powers the magic:

**Frontend**: React + TypeScript for a snappy, type-safe experience  
**API Layer**: AWS API Gateway handling millions of requests effortlessly  
**Logic**: Lambda functions that wake up only when needed  
**Storage**: DynamoDB with single-table design for sub-10ms queries  
**Assets**: S3 + CloudFront for global content delivery

**Infrastructure as Code**: Everything deployed via Terraform for reproducible, version-controlled infrastructure.

## Quick Start

**Want to try it?** Just visit [budgetlink.###](https://budgetlink.###) and start building.

**Want to run it locally?**

```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev

# Infrastructure  
cd infra && terraform init && terraform apply
```

**Requirements**: Node.js 18+, AWS CLI configured, Terraform installed.

## Inspiration

BudgetLink was born from frustration with existing budgeting apps that require everyone to create accounts just to split a grocery bill. I asked: "What if budgeting worked more like sharing a Google Doc or a PcPartPicker link?"

The answer is a tool that gets out of your way and lets you focus on what matters: understanding and controlling your money.
